My ssh connections were idle and terminated very quickly, after 1-2 min of inactivity. I fixed this by editing "ssh_config" file in local computer


before editing, my ssh_config read:
```
Host *
        SendEnv LANG LC_*
```

nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config

"permission denied". Will need sudo to edit.

sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config

# I then added these two lines:

```
Host *
        SendEnv LANG LC_*
        ServerAliveInterval 60
        ServerAliveCountMax 2
```

# ServerAliveInterval 60, is sending a "package" to the remote server, every 60 second. This is checking that the server still there.
# I set it to 60 seconds (number will always be in seconds). If it still disconnects, then you need to dial this number down still the connection is stable. 

# ServerAliveCountMax 2, is telling ssh, how many times to send the package. This case it will try twice. If doesn't get a response, it will disconnect.
