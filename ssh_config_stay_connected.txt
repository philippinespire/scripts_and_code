My ssh connections were idle and terminated very quickly, after 1-2 min of inactivity. I fixed this by editing "ssh_config" file in local computer

Potential problem: my house internet router, it might be set up for open-and-end connectons. 
HTML, using internet in the house, I think those activities secured a connection and once successful, it closes.
Thus, it does not keep connections open to long to save memory???

nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config

before editing my ssh_config read:
```
Host *
        SendEnv LANG LC_*
```

permission denied. need sudo to edit.

sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config

# I then added these two lines:

```
Host *
        SendEnv LANG LC_*
        ServerAliveInterval 60
        ServerAliveCountMax 2
```

# ServerAliveInterval 60, is sending a "package" to the remote server, every 60 second. This is checking that the server still there.
# I set it to 60 seconds (number will always be in seconds). If it still disconnect then you need to dial this number down still the connection is stable. 

# ServerAliveCountMax 2, is telling ssh, how many times to send the pacakage. This case it will try twice. If doesn't get a response, it will disconnect.
