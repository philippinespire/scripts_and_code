### Multi_FASTQC.sh

Simple script to create sequence quality reports ([FASTQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/)) in parallel with a single command on a remote HPC

Usage - Place script in same directory as files to be processed and execute specifying the extension of files between quotations. For example:
```
sbatch Multi_FASTQC.sh "fq.gz"
```

`Multi_FASTQC.sh` has been tested in "fq", "fq.gz" and "bam" files.

### base_calculator.sh

This script counts the number of each base in DNA fragments from single-digest Sbf1 RADseq, pair-end fq.gz files according to the window size and region determined by user

Usage:

1.- Place script in the same directory with files to be processed. Open script and:

2.- Set slurm options according to your system

3.- Set "User Variables" 

4.- Check that the ls statement in line 69 will list your input files. Modify regex if necessary

5.- Execute in command with: sbatch <script name> <"readDir">
```
sbatch base_calculator.sh "F"
```
Output:
  
  * TSV table with file names, base counts, and read information.

### base_proportions.R

R script to calculate, and plot, base pair proportions and mean base pair proportion of DNA fragments position by position

Uses the output of "base_calculator.sh", or tsv files with base pair counts from single digest RADseq, paired-End sequencing data, as input

### read_calculator.sh

read_caltulator.sh counts the number of reads in compressed (default) or uncompressed FQ files (open script for details).

Usage: 

1.- Place script in the same directory with FQ files to be processed. Open script and:

2.- Set slurm options according to your system

3.- Set "User Variables"

4.- Execute
```
sbatch read_calculator.sh
```
Output:
  
  * CSV table with file names and total number of reads

### motif_calculator.sh

motif_calculator.sh identifies and counts repeated motifs in compressed or uncompressed FQ files

Usage:

Users set file and read info as well as the maximum length (bp) of motifs to be counted and the calculator lists and reports frequencies of all motifs within the size range of "position 1", or the first bp, to the specified maximum length (from beginning  of reads only).

User variables options:

FILE_DIRECTION ("forward" or "reverse") 

DIRECTION_SUFFIX ("F","R","R1","R2", etc)  

FILE_EXTENSION ("fq" or "fq.gz" for uncompressed and compressed files, respectively) 

MAX_motif_length (digit)(maximum motif size (in bp) to search for repeats)

THREADS (number of threads according to your system)

### concat_fqFiles_diffLanes.sh

Simple script to concatenate files of the same individuals but from multiple sequencing lanes

Usage: Open the script can enter your files' read and lane info 

---

### subsetting_VCF_files.dat

User friendly list of steps and code to successfully subset VCF files while maintaining functionality

---

### ssh_config_stay_connected.txt

Use this code to maintain a stable ssh connection if your sessions are becoming idle and/or terminated very quickly, after 1-2 min of inactivity.
